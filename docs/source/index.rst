Welcome to mycosmo's documentation!
===================================

.. warning::
   This is a demonstration package created for a course on Scientific Software Development.
   The package and its documentation are designed to showcase best practices in scientific
   software development. This is not a real cosmology package and should not be used in
   actual research.

mycosmo is a Python package designed for cosmological calculations and analysis. It provides
essential tools for working with cosmological parameters and performing fundamental
cosmological calculations.

Key Features
------------

- Calculation of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts
- Computation of critical density in the universe
- Standard cosmological constants and unit conversions
- Support for various cosmological models through parameter dictionaries

Example Usage
-------------

The package can be used to calculate important cosmological parameters. For example,
here's how the Hubble parameter and critical density vary with redshift:
